We will use Infrared Sensor to detect empty slots and then send notification using email(IFTTT service). 
Realtime slots can be checked at the blynk app or at the thingspeak platform.

ThingSpeak is an open source IoT application and API to store and retrieve data from things using the HTTP and MQTT protocol over the Internet or via LAN.
ThingSpeak enables the creation of sensor logging applications and a social network of things with status updates.

IFTTT stands for “If This Then That”. It is a free web based service to create chains of simple conditional statements, called applets.

Services are the basic building blocks of IFTTT.They mainly describe a series of data from a certain web service such as youtube etc. 
Services also describe actions controlled with certain API’s like SMS. Each service has a particular set of triggers and actions.
Applets are the predicates made from Triggers and Actions.
Triggers are the “This” part of an applet. They are the items that trigger the action.
Actions are the “That” part of an applet. They are the output that results from the input of thhe trigger.
